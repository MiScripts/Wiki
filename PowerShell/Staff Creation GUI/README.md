# Staff Creation Frame
Basic GUI based staff creation script for AD and Google!


## Requirements
1. GAM - https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM
2. AD Enviroment with current user permissions allowed for user creation / disabling

## Layout
The funciton of this script is to add some semblence of structure on how you can add users and disable users, depending on your enviroment this script is meant to be customizable and highly sectional though you may need to play around with it some to figure out the sizing and column setups for the GUI.

StaffCreationSource should be in the same directory as the StaffCreationGUI

The two main parts are followed:
1. The GUI,
   This holds all the actual running scripts with the functions and different switchs/procedures you can set it to run as
3. The Source, 
   This holds all the custom variables, idealy this would be encrypted or at least have some security protection on it since it is meant to hold service account data and variables specific to your enviroment
