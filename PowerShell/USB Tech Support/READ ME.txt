HOW TO USE:
Copy this whole directory onto a usb and plug that into the target device

Make sure you are logged into the machine on an admin account you don't want to wipe

Run the 'runme.bat' file

To close just exit the program

You can also run this from USB and when it loads (it will all be in memory) you can remove the USB and continue if you are running Rip and Tear on multiple PCs

Any issues or concerns see your Systems Administrator :)
