<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>MiScripts.org was born out of a visionary idea that took shape during the MAEDS 2023 conference. Recognizing the pressing need for a centralized repository of scripts to streamline educational processes, a collaborative spark was ignited among conference attendees from multiple school districts and ISD/RESAs.</p>
<p>Chris Thomas (Ingham ISD), Eric Krebill (TriCounty Schools), Jim Stalbaum (Wayne RESA) and Rob Lane (Wayne RESA) played pivotal roles in these initial discussions. Their collective vision and shared commitment to enhancing educational efficiency led to the inception of MiScripts.org, a platform designed to empower technical administrators with a comprehensive script library for the benefit of Michiganâ€™s K-12 educational community.</p>
